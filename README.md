# GitHub Pages Deployment
The goal of this project is to learn the notion of continuous integration and continuous deployment. I will write a simple GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.


### Project Step
- Created a simple index.html file saying “Hello, GitHub Actions!” in the repository.
- By following the steps from the [doc](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow), I published the site in github pages using a custom Github Action workflow.
- Every push to the main branch that changes the index.html file triggers the workflow to run and deploy the website to GitHub Pages.
- The website and any changes I make will be accessible at the GitHub Pages URL for the repository  https://vishal-ponsekar.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/.
